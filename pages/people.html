                        Xiaoling Shi received her Ph.D. in Modern Chinese Literature at the University of Arizona in 2009, her minor being Teaching Chinese as a Second Language. Before coming to the USA, she worked as a high school Chinese teacher in mainland China for two years and a secondary school Chinese teacher in Singapore for three years. After graduation from Tucson, AZ, she was an Assistant Professor in Chinese at Rhodes College, Memphis, TN for one year. Since 2010, she has been directing the Chinese program at Allegheny College and restructuring the curriculum. In the summer of 2018 and 2019, she and her team were granted the Demmler Award for Innovative Teaching from Allegheny College to revamp the Beginning and Intermediate Chinese Language courses. By using animations to facilitate language practice and creating online games to motivate students, she experienced first-hand the power of image, multimedia, and games to create a dynamic classroom. Identifying the success of the revamped curriculum derived from cultural content, digital/social media engagement, and communal learning, she led her team to present it at local, regional, and national conferences from 2018-2019. In 2020, she continues to guide her team in classrooms to experiment content-based learning by utilizing online resources, digital project-based learning by employing online engagement tools/platforms, and collaborative learning by integrating interdisciplinary skills in language classrooms.

                                    Kaidi Chen is currently a Ph.D. candidate (ABD) in Applied Linguistics and Discourse 
                                    Studies at the University of Connecticut. He is also a member of the UConn Laboratory 
                                    for Spoken Language Processing, a student in the Certificate Program of UConn Cognitive 
                                    Science, and affiliated to the Connecticut Institute of Brain and Cognitive Science. He 
                                    received his B.A. (with honors) in Chinese Language and Literature in mainland China and 
                                    M.A. in Chinese Linguistics in Macau. Before embarking on the Ph.D. program, he had 
                                    extensive experiences in teaching Chinese language courses. He taught at Trinity College 
                                    in 2018-19 and at Allegheny College from 2016-18. He has also been working for the 
                                    prestigious Middlebury Summer Language School for 3 years in a row from 2018 to 2020. 
                                    He is interested in bilingualism and second language acquisition, psycholinguistics, 
                                    sociolinguistics and language pedagogy. He has a book chapter on Chinese pronunciations 
                                    in 2021, and has contributed to the book Teaching Beginning Chinese Grammar: Communicative 
                                    Strategies and Activities, published in 2020. He joined the launching of the grant project 
                                    in the summer of 2018 and presented it with his colleagues at local, regional and national 
                                    conferences. In teaching, his interest lies on how to develop learners’ intercultural 
                                    competence/citizenship while cultivating their communicative abilities. He has been 
                                    increasingly integrating modern technology and diverse modalities into his classroom to 
                                    develop authentic activities and build interactive, social and collaborative learning 
                                    environments.

                                    Chih-Jung Chen is currently pursuing her Master’s degree in Information Science at Rochester 
                                    Institute of Technology, focusing on Human-Computer Interaction and Web Development. She is a 
                                    native Taiwanese and can also speak the dialect Taiwanese Hokkien. Prior to embarking on her 
                                    career in Information Science, she taught Chinese at Allegheny College first as a teaching 
                                    assistant then as an independent instructor, where she actively applied technology such as 
                                    gamified activities and content visualization in classrooms. Because of her contributions to 
                                    the launching of the grant project in the summer of 2018 and 2019, she was granted travel 
                                    awards from Allegheny College to present it with her colleagues at local, regional, and 
                                    national conferences. While studying Information Science at Rochester, she has actively 
                                    participated in the grant project since May 2020 and strongly advocated for the idea that 
                                    technology should be built with accessibility in mind, to accommodate disabled learners, for 
                                    instance. Her Master’s capstone project will be about distance learning. With her expertise in 
                                    computer science and passion for education, she is dedicated to empowering learners through 
                                    technology.

                                    Runqi Deng is a teaching assistant at Allegheny College, where she works to explore content-based 
                                    learning and project-based learning by utilizing Web 2.0 learning engagement tools/platforms. 
                                    She received her master’s degree in foreign language education from the University of Pittsburgh 
                                    in 2020. The course work she studies there includes technology in foreign language, psychology of 
                                    learning and development for education, sociology of education, etc. Before arriving at Allegheny, 
                                    she taught English in K-12 settings in mainland China. She believes that teaching language and 
                                    culture should aim to empower learners to become global citizens, in which language proficiency, 
                                    critical thinking, and intercultural competence are equally important. Although Deng’s position at 
                                    Allegheny is scheduled to end at the completion of the spring 2021 semester, she is committed to 
                                    this project and will serve as a consultant.

                                    Institute of Technology, focusing on Human-Computer Interaction and Web Development. She is a 
                                    native Taiwanese and can also speak the dialect Taiwanese Hokkien. Prior to embarking on her 
                                    career in Information Science, she taught Chinese at Allegheny College first as a teaching 
                                    assistant then as an independent instructor, where she actively applied technology such as 
                                    gamified activities and content visualization in classrooms. Because of her contributions to 
                                    the launching of the grant project in the summer of 2018 and 2019, she was granted travel

                                    participated in the grant project since May 2020 and strongly advocated for the idea that 
                                    technology should be built with accessibility in mind, to accommodate disabled learners, for 
                                    instance. Her Master’s capstone project will be about distance learning. With her expertise in

                                    Runqi Deng is a teaching assistant at Allegheny College, where she works to explore content-based 
                                    learning and project-based learning by utilizing Web 2.0 learning engagement tools/platforms. 
                                    She received her master’s degree in foreign language education from the University of Pittsburgh 
                                    in 2020. The course work she studies there includes technology in foreign language, psychology of 
                                    learning and development for education, sociology of education, etc. Before arriving at Allegheny, 
                                    she taught English in K-12 settings in mainland China. She believes that teaching language and 
                                    culture should aim to empower learners to become global citizens, in which language proficiency, 
                                    critical thinking, and intercultural competence are equally important. Although Deng’s position at 
                                    Allegheny is scheduled to end at the completion of the spring 2021 semester, she is committed to 
                                    this project and will serve as a consultant.
