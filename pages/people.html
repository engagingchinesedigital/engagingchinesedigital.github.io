                        Xiaoling Shi received her Ph.D. in Modern Chinese Literature at the University of Arizona in 2009, her minor being Teaching Chinese as a Second Language. Before coming to the USA, she worked as a high school Chinese teacher in mainland China for two years and a secondary school Chinese teacher in Singapore for three years. After graduation from Tucson, AZ, she was an Assistant Professor in Chinese at Rhodes College, Memphis, TN for one year. Since 2010, she has been directing the Chinese program at Allegheny College and restructuring the curriculum. In the summer of 2018 and 2019, she and her team were granted the Demmler Award for Innovative Teaching from Allegheny College to revamp the Beginning and Intermediate Chinese Language courses. By using animations to facilitate language practice and creating online games to motivate students, she experienced first-hand the power of image, multimedia, and games to create a dynamic classroom. Identifying the success of the revamped curriculum derived from cultural content, digital/social media engagement, and communal learning, she led her team to present it at local, regional, and national conferences from 2018-2019. In 2020, she continues to guide her team in classrooms to experiment content-based learning by utilizing online resources, digital project-based learning by employing online engagement tools/platforms, and collaborative learning by integrating interdisciplinary skills in language classrooms.
